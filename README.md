This is a place for me to practice implementing various textbook algorithms. The
purpose of this repository is to help me prepare for coding interviews. I've
provided my code here as a reference to other people who may want to understand
how these algorithms work.

I consider this code to all be in the public domain; see the LICENSE file for
details.

**Pro tip:** There's a well-regarded textbook on the subject, which you can
download using the following command:

```bash
eval $(echo "Zm9yIG51bSBpbiB7MS4uMTB9OyBkbyBjdXJsIC1MIC1PIGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmVlY3MuYmVy
a2VsZXkuZWR1L352YXppcmFuaS9hbGdvcml0aG1zL2NoYXAieyRudW19Ii5wZGY7IGRvbmUK" | base64 -d -)
```
