This is a place for me to practice implementing various textbook algorithms. The
purpose of this repository is to help me prepare for coding interviews. I've
provided my code here as a reference to other people who may want to understand
how these algorithms work.

I consider this code to all be in the public domain; see the LICENSE file for
